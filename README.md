# Memory Card Game

This Memory Card Game is an interactive web application where players are presented with 12 cards featuring different Pok√©mon, fetched dynamically from a Pok√©mon API. The objective is to match pairs of cards by clicking on them. Each time a unique card is clicked, the player's score increments by one. If the same card is clicked more than once before a match is found, the score resets to zero. The game keeps track of the best score achieved during the session. It's a fun and engaging way to test and improve memory skills using the beloved characters from the Pok√©mon universe. To set up the game, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the development server.
